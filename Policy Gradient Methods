# Policy gradient methods are a class of reinforcement learning algorithms used in deep learning that aim to learn an optimal policy for an agent in a given environment. In reinforcement learning, an agent takes actions in an environment to maximize a reward signal over time. The goal of policy gradient methods is to learn a policy that can map observations from the environment to actions that maximize the expected cumulative reward.

# The policy is typically represented as a neural network, with the input being the state of the environment and the output being a probability distribution over actions. The parameters of the network are updated by gradient descent using the policy gradient theorem, which provides a way to compute the gradient of the expected reward with respect to the policy parameters.

# The policy gradient methods can be used in both continuous and discrete action spaces and are effective in solving complex tasks with high-dimensional state and action spaces. They have been successfully applied to various applications such as game playing, robotics, and natural language processing.

# Here's a Python code sample of the Policy Gradient method using the TensorFlow library:
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define the neural network for the policy
class PolicyNetwork(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, state_dim, action_dim, hidden_size):
        super(PolicyNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.hidden_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(hidden_size, activation='relu')
        self.output_layer = tf.keras.layers.Dense(action_dim, activation='softmax')

    def call(self, inputs):
        x = self.hidden_layer(inputs)
        x = self.output_layer(x)
        return x

# Define the policy gradient loss function
def policy_gradient_loss(actions, log_probs, rewards):
    # Compute the policy gradient
    policy_gradient = -tf.reduce_sum(tf.math.multiply(log_probs, rewards))

    # Compute the gradients of the policy network
    grads = tape.gradient(policy_gradient, policy_net.trainable_variables)

    # Apply the gradients to update the policy network parameters
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, policy_net.trainable_variables))

    return policy_gradient

# Initialize the environment and the policy network
env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')
state_dim = env.observation_space.shape[0]
action_dim = env.action_space.n
hidden_size = 32
policy_net = PolicyNetwork(state_dim, action_dim, hidden_size)
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()

# Train the policy network using the policy gradient method
for episode in range(num_episodes):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False
    episode_reward = 0

    while not done:
        # Compute the action distribution and sample an action from it
        logits = policy_net(tf.convert_to_tensor(state[None, :], dtype=tf.float32))
        action = tf.random.categorical(logits, num_samples=1)[0, 0]

        # Take the action in the environment and observe the next state and reward
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        episode_reward += reward

        # Compute the log probability of the chosen action
        log_prob = tf.math.log(tf.squeeze(tf.gather(logits, action)))

        # Store the transition in the memory buffer
        memory_buffer.store(state, action, log_prob, reward)

        # Update the state
        state = next_state

    # Compute the cumulative rewards for the entire episode
    cumulative_rewards = memory_buffer.compute_cumulative_rewards()

    # Compute the normalized rewards
    mean_reward = np.mean(cumulative_rewards)
    std_reward = np.std(cumulative_rewards)
    normalized_rewards = (cumulative_rewards - mean_reward) / (std_reward + 1e-8)

    # Compute the policy gradient loss and update the policy network parameters
    policy_gradient_loss(actions, log_probs, normalized_rewards)

# Note that this code sample assumes that the gym and numpy libraries are installed. Also, this is just a simplified implementation of the Policy Gradient method and may not include some of the advanced techniques used in modern research.
