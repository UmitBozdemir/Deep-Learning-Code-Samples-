# Unsupervised pre-training is a technique used in deep learning where a model is first trained on a large dataset in an unsupervised manner, without using any labeled data, to learn general patterns and representations in the data. This pre-training stage is typically performed using an autoencoder or a variant of it, where the model is trained to reconstruct its input data from a lower-dimensional representation learned by the model.

# Once the unsupervised pre-training is completed, the model is fine-tuned on a smaller labeled dataset for a specific task, such as image classification or natural language processing. Fine-tuning involves adjusting the parameters of the pre-trained model to make it more suitable for the target task by using the labeled data to learn task-specific patterns.

# Unsupervised pre-training can be useful in scenarios where labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain, as it allows the model to learn from a larger dataset of unlabeled data before fine-tuning on the smaller labeled dataset. This approach has been shown to improve the performance of deep learning models in many applications, especially when the amount of labeled data is limited.

# Here's a code sample in Python using the Keras deep learning framework to perform unsupervised pre-training using an autoencoder:
from keras.layers import Input, Dense
from keras.models import Model

# Define input shape
input_shape = (784,)

# Define encoder architecture
input_layer = Input(shape=input_shape)
encoded = Dense(128, activation='relu')(input_layer)
encoded = Dense(64, activation='relu')(encoded)
encoded = Dense(32, activation='relu')(encoded)

# Define decoder architecture
decoded = Dense(64, activation='relu')(encoded)
decoded = Dense(128, activation='relu')(decoded)
decoded = Dense(784, activation='sigmoid')(decoded)

# Define autoencoder model
autoencoder = Model(input_layer, decoded)

# Compile autoencoder model
autoencoder.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

# Train autoencoder model on unlabeled data
autoencoder.fit(unlabeled_data, unlabeled_data, epochs=10, batch_size=128)

# Extract encoder part of the model
encoder = Model(input_layer, encoded)

# Freeze encoder layers
for layer in encoder.layers:
    layer.trainable = False
    
# Define classifier architecture
classifier = Dense(10, activation='softmax')(encoded)

# Define fine-tuned model
finetuned_model = Model(input_layer, classifier)

# Compile fine-tuned model
finetuned_model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train fine-tuned model on labeled data
finetuned_model.fit(labeled_data, labels, epochs=10, batch_size=128)

# In this code sample, we first define the architecture of an autoencoder, which is trained on unlabeled data to learn a lower-dimensional representation of the data. We then extract the encoder part of the autoencoder, freeze its layers, and add a classifier layer on top to create a fine-tuned model. Finally, we compile and train the fine-tuned model on labeled data for a specific task.
