# Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that are designed to address the problem of the vanishing gradient in traditional RNNs. LSTMs are capable of learning long-term dependencies by selectively remembering and forgetting information over time.

# An LSTM network is composed of a series of LSTM cells, each of which has three gates: an input gate, an output gate, and a forget gate. These gates control the flow of information into and out of the cell, as well as the retention or forgetting of previous cell states.

# At each time step, the LSTM cell takes in an input and a previous hidden state, and outputs a new hidden state and a new output. The input gate determines which parts of the input should be remembered, while the forget gate determines which parts of the previous cell state should be retained. The output gate controls which parts of the current cell state should be outputted.

# LSTMs are commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as language translation, speech recognition, and sentiment analysis, as well as in other applications such as image captioning and time series prediction.

# Here is a code sample of a basic LSTM network using Keras in Python:
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import LSTM, Dense

# Define the model architecture
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(128, input_shape=(10, 1))) # 128 LSTM units with input size 10x1
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')) # output layer with sigmoid activation

# Compile the model
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Evaluate the model
score = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, batch_size=32)
print('Test loss:', score[0])
print('Test accuracy:', score[1])

# In this example, we define an LSTM network with one LSTM layer consisting of 128 units and an input shape of 10 time steps with one feature. We add a dense output layer with a sigmoid activation function. We then compile the model using binary crossentropy as the loss function, Adam optimizer, and accuracy as the evaluation metric. Finally, we train and evaluate the model using a training and testing dataset.
