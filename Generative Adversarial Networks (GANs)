# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a type of deep learning algorithm that consists of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator.

# The generator network takes random noise as input and generates a synthetic output that mimics real data, such as images or sounds. The discriminator network takes in both real and synthetic data and tries to distinguish between them.

# During training, the generator tries to produce outputs that can fool the discriminator into thinking they are real, while the discriminator tries to correctly identify which inputs are real and which are synthetic. The two networks are trained simultaneously, with the goal of improving the quality of the generated outputs over time.

# In essence, GANs are designed to create synthetic data that is similar enough to real data to be useful for a particular application. They have been successfully used in a variety of fields, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and drug discovery.

# Here's a simple code example of a GAN implemented using the TensorFlow library in Python:
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the generator network
generator = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(256, input_shape=(100,), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(784, activation='tanh'),
    tf.keras.layers.Reshape((28,28,1))
])

# Define the discriminator network
discriminator = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28,28,1)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(256, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Define the GAN model
gan = tf.keras.Sequential([generator, discriminator])

# Compile the discriminator separately
discriminator.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam')

# Freeze the discriminator while training the generator
discriminator.trainable = False

# Compile the GAN model with a custom loss function
def gan_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    return tf.keras.losses.binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred)

gan.compile(loss=gan_loss, optimizer='adam')

# Train the GAN model
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    # Generate random noise
    noise = tf.random.normal((batch_size, 100))
    
    # Generate fake images from the noise
    fake_images = generator.predict(noise)
    
    # Get real images from the dataset
    real_images = get_real_images(batch_size)
    
    # Concatenate real and fake images
    x = tf.concat([real_images, fake_images], axis=0)
    
    # Labels for the discriminator
    y_discriminator = tf.constant([[1.]] * batch_size + [[0.]] * batch_size)
    
    # Train the discriminator
    discriminator.trainable = True
    discriminator.train_on_batch(x, y_discriminator)
    
    # Train the generator
    noise = tf.random.normal((batch_size, 100))
    y_generator = tf.constant([[1.]] * batch_size)
    discriminator.trainable = False
    gan.train_on_batch(noise, y_generator)

# This code defines a GAN with a generator that takes random noise as input and produces synthetic images, and a discriminator that tries to distinguish between real and fake images. The GAN model is trained by optimizing both the generator and discriminator simultaneously, with the goal of generating synthetic images that are indistinguishable from real images.
