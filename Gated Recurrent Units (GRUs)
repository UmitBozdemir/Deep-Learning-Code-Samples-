# Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that were introduced as a simpler alternative to the more complex Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture. GRUs are designed to overcome the vanishing gradient problem that can occur in traditional RNNs when trying to train them on long sequences of data.

# GRUs have two gates, a reset gate and an update gate, that control the flow of information through the network. The reset gate determines how much of the previous hidden state to forget, while the update gate determines how much of the new input to add to the current hidden state.

# The mathematical equations used in GRUs are similar to those used in LSTMs, but with fewer parameters. Specifically, GRUs have a single hidden state vector that is updated at each time step, while LSTMs have both a hidden state vector and a cell state vector that are updated separately.

# Overall, GRUs have shown to be effective for a variety of sequence modeling tasks, including language modeling, speech recognition, and machine translation.

# Here is a code sample of a simple GRU model implemented in Python using the Keras library:
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import GRU, Dense

# Define the GRU model
model = Sequential()
model.add(GRU(units=128, input_shape=(None, 1), activation='tanh', return_sequences=True))
model.add(GRU(units=64, activation='tanh'))
model.add(Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# In this example, the model consists of two GRU layers with 128 and 64 units, respectively, and an output layer with a sigmoid activation function. The input shape is defined as (None, 1) to allow for variable-length sequences of 1-dimensional data. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function, and is trained on some input data X_train and corresponding output labels y_train for 10 epochs with a batch size of 32.
