# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of deep learning algorithm that is primarily used for image recognition, classification, and segmentation tasks.

# At a high level, a CNN consists of several layers, each of which performs a specific computation on the input data. The core of a CNN is its convolutional layer, which applies a set of learnable filters (also called kernels or weights) to the input image to extract important features. The filters slide over the image in a systematic way, computing a dot product between themselves and the image pixels they overlap with.

# The output of the convolutional layer is then passed through one or more activation functions, such as ReLU, to introduce non-linearity and increase the network's expressive power. Additional layers such as pooling and normalization layers may also be added to reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps and improve the network's ability to generalize.

# Finally, the feature maps are flattened and fed into one or more fully connected layers, which act as a classifier to produce a probability distribution over the possible output classes.

# Training a CNN involves iteratively adjusting the weights of the filters to minimize a loss function that measures the difference between the network's predictions and the true labels of the training data. This is typically done using backpropagation, a gradient-based optimization algorithm that computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to the network parameters and updates them accordingly.

# Here is an example of a simple Convolutional Neural Network implemented in Python using the Keras library:
import keras
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense
from keras.models import Sequential

# Define the model architecture
model = Sequential()
model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)))
model.add(MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
model.add(Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))

# Compile the model with appropriate loss function, optimizer and metrics
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model on the training data
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=128, validation_data=(x_test, y_test))

# Evaluate the model on the test data
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print('Test accuracy:', test_acc)

# This code defines a simple CNN with three convolutional layers, two max pooling layers, and two fully connected layers. The input data is 28x28 grayscale images, and the output is a probability distribution over 10 classes (digits 0-9).

# The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function. It is then trained on the MNIST dataset for 10 epochs, with a batch size of 128. Finally, the model is evaluated on the test set and the test accuracy is printed.
