# Deep Residual Networks, or ResNets, are a type of neural network architecture used in deep learning. They were introduced in 2015 by Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, and Jian Sun.

# The basic idea behind ResNets is to use residual connections, which allow information to be passed through the network unchanged. This is accomplished by adding skip connections that bypass some of the layers in the network.

# The skip connections in ResNets allow gradients to flow more easily through the network during training, which helps to alleviate the vanishing gradient problem that can occur in very deep neural networks. By using these skip connections, ResNets can be made much deeper than traditional neural networks, while still maintaining good performance.

# ResNets have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide range of computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.

# Here's an example of building a deep residual network using PyTorch:

    def __init__(self, block, num_blocks, num_classes=10):
        super(ResNet, self).__init__()

# This code defines a ResNet architecture with four layers, each consisting of several ResBlocks. The ResBlock class defines the basic residual block used in the network, while the ResNet class puts these blocks together to create the full architecture. The ResNet18 function returns an instance of this ResNet architecture with 18 layers, consisting of two blocks in the first three layers and four blocks in the last layer. The ResNet18 function can be called to create an instance of this ResNet architecture.

# The forward function of the ResNet class takes an input tensor and passes it through the various layers of the network. The input tensor is first passed through a convolutional layer with 64 filters, followed by a batch normalization layer and a ReLU activation. Then, the input is passed through the four layers of ResBlocks, with each layer containing a different number of blocks. Finally, the output is passed through an adaptive average pooling layer, which reduces the spatial dimensions of the output to 1x1, and then through a linear layer with 10 output classes.

# Overall, this code sample shows how to build a ResNet architecture in PyTorch, using the ResBlock class to define the basic building block of the network and the ResNet class to put these blocks together to create a full architecture.
