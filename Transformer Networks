# Transformer networks are a type of deep learning architecture that was introduced in 2017 by Vaswani et al. in the paper "Attention Is All You Need." Transformer networks are primarily used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as machine translation, language modeling, and text generation.

# The key innovation of Transformer networks is their use of self-attention mechanisms, which allow the network to selectively focus on different parts of the input sequence during processing. Unlike traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Transformer networks do not rely on a fixed, sequential processing order.

# Instead, Transformer networks use multi-head attention, which computes attention scores between all pairs of positions in the input sequence in parallel. This allows the network to capture complex relationships between different parts of the input sequence, without being limited by the sequential nature of RNNs or the local connectivity of CNNs.

# Transformer networks typically consist of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder processes the input sequence using multiple layers of self-attention and feedforward networks, while the decoder generates the output sequence by attending to the encoded input sequence and using self-attention to generate the output one token at a time.

# Overall, Transformer networks have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of NLP tasks, and their success has led to the development of numerous transformer-based models such as BERT, GPT-2, and T5.

# Here's a code sample of a basic transformer network for sequence-to-sequence learning using PyTorch:

import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class TransformerEncoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hid_dim, n_layers, n_heads, pf_dim, dropout):
        super().__init__()

        self.tok_embedding = nn.Embedding(input_dim, hid_dim)
        self.pos_embedding = nn.Embedding(1000, hid_dim)

        self.layers = nn.ModuleList([TransformerEncoderLayer(hid_dim, n_heads, pf_dim, dropout) for _ in range(n_layers)])

        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)
        self.scale = torch.sqrt(torch.FloatTensor([hid_dim])).to(device)

        #src = [batch_size, src_len]

        batch_size = src.shape[0]

        for layer in self.layers:
            src = layer(src)

        #src = [batch_size, src_len, hid_dim]

        return src

            nn.Dropout(dropout)
        )
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)

    def forward(self, src):

        #src = [batch_size, src_len, hid_dim]

        #self attention
        _src, _ = self.self_attention(src, src, src)

        #dropout, residual connection and layer norm
        src = self.self_attn_layer_norm(src + self.dropout(_src))

        #src = [batch_size, src_len, hid_dim]

        #positionwise feedforward
        _src = self.positionwise_feedforward(src)

        #dropout, residual and layer norm
        src = self.ff_layer_norm(src + self.dropout(_src))

        #src = [batch_size, src_len, hid_dim]

        return src

# This code defines a TransformerEncoder class and a TransformerEncoderLayer class, which can be used to build an encoder for a transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model. The TransformerEncoder takes in an input sequence, applies multiple self-attention layers, and outputs an encoded representation of the input sequence. The TransformerEncoderLayer is used to define the individual self-attention layers within the encoder.

# Note that this is just a basic example, and the architecture and hyperparameters may need to be modified depending on the specific task and dataset.
