# L2 regularization, also known as Ridge regularization, is a common regularization technique used in deep learning to prevent overfitting of the model.

# In this technique, an L2 penalty term is added to the loss function, which penalizes the model for using large weights by adding the sum of the squared values of all model weights to the loss function. This penalty encourages the model to use smaller weights, which can help to prevent overfitting.

# The L2 regularization term is controlled by a hyperparameter called the regularization strength or regularization parameter, which determines the strength of the penalty term. A higher regularization strength will lead to smaller weights and a more generalizable model, but may also lead to underfitting if set too high.

# The L2 regularization technique is widely used in various deep learning models, such as neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks.

# Here's a code sample in Python using the Keras API for implementing L2 regularization in a neural network:
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras import regularizers

# Initialize model
model = Sequential()

# Add layers with L2 regularization
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_dim=100, kernel_regularizer=regularizers.l2(0.01)))
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', kernel_regularizer=regularizers.l2(0.01)))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid', kernel_regularizer=regularizers.l2(0.01)))

# Compile model with appropriate optimizer and loss function
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(x_val, y_val))

# In this example, we use the kernel_regularizer argument when adding layers to the neural network to apply L2 regularization to the weights of the layer. The regularizers.l2 function specifies the L2 regularization strength, which is set to 0.01 in this example.

# By using L2 regularization, the model will try to minimize the loss function while also keeping the weights small, which can help to prevent overfitting of the training data.
